Financial results for the seven months ended October 31, 1999<p>
*********************************************************<p>
<p>
<p>
	The Government announced today (Tuesday) its financial results for the seven months ended October 31, 1999.<p>
<p>
	Expenditure for the period April to October 1999 amounted to $128,548.8 million and revenue to $78,493.4 million, resulting in a deficit of $50,055.4 million.<p>
<p>
	The fiscal reserves stood at $384,247 million at October 31, a decrease of $50,055.4 million compared with the balance of $434,302.4 million at March 31, 1999, the end of the previous financial year.<p>
<p>
	On the deficit, a Government spokesman explained that since the Government's accounts were prepared on a cash basis, they reflected the incidence of receipts and payments during the period.<p>
<p>
	"The bulk of collections from Profits Tax and Salaries Tax were normally received in the latter part of the year, with roughly 85% of Profits Tax in the last five months and 80% of Salaries Tax in the last three months," he said.<p>
<p>
	"Therefore, it was not unusual, even in good years, to see a deficit at this time of the financial year," he added.<p>
<p>
	More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<p>
