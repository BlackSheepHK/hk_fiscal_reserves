	    ***********************************************************<p>

	    &nbsp; &nbsp;  The Government announced today (April 30) its provisional financial results for the year ended March 31, 2008.<br/><br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;  Expenditure for the year ended March 31, 2008, amounted to $234.8 billion and revenue $358.4 billion, resulting in a surplus of $123.6 billion.<br/><br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;  A government spokesman said that the surplus of $123.6 billion represented an improvement of $8 billion over the $115.6 billion surplus forecast in the 2008-09 Budget.&nbsp; He said the improved financial position was mainly due to the higher than expected collection of profits tax and stamp duties towards the end of the financial year.&nbsp; Revenue for the year was $5.5 billion higher than forecast.<br/><br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;  At the same time, expenditure for the year was $2.5 billion lower than forecast mainly as a result of the strenuous efforts of departments to rein in expenditure and spend only where necessary.<br/><br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;  The fiscal reserves stood at $492.9 billion as at March 31, 2008, an increase of $123.6 billion compared with the balance of $369.3 billion as at March 31, 2007.<br/><br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;  The spokesman added that all figures were provisional pending the final closing of the annual accounts but experience showed that any changes to the provisional figures were unlikely to be significant.<br/><br/>&nbsp; &nbsp;  More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<br/><br/><br/>TABLE 1.&nbsp;  CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNT (PROVISIONAL)<br/><br/><br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Month ended&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Year ended <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; March 31,2008&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; March 31,2008<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; HK$ million&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; HK$ million <br/><br/>Revenue&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  23,868.4&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 358,445.3<br/>Expenditure&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (23,677.3)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (234,790.9)<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ----------&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -----------<br/>Surplus&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  191.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  123,654.4<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  ----------&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -----------<br/>Financing<br/><br/>Domestic<br/>Banking Sector (Note 1)(321.0)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (124,748.3)<br/>Non-Banking Sector&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 129.9&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1,093.9<br/>External&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ----------&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ------------<br/>Total&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (191.1)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (123,654.4)<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------<br/>Government Debts as at March 31, 2008<br/>(Note 2)<br/>HK$20,064.4 million<br/>Debts Guaranteed by Government as at March 31, 2008 <br/>(Note 3) <br/>HK$4,094.8 million<br/>-------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>TABLE 2.&nbsp;  FISCAL RESERVES (PROVISIONAL)<br/><br/><br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Month ended&nbsp; &nbsp;  Year ended <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  March 31,2008&nbsp;  March 31,2008<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  HK$ million&nbsp; &nbsp;  HK$ million <br/><br/>Fiscal Reserves at&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 492,727.5&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  369,264.2 <br/>start of period&nbsp;  <br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <br/>Add : Consolidated Surplus&nbsp; 191.1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  123,654.4<br/>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ----------&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ----------<br/>Fiscal Reserves at&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 492,918.6&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 492,918.6 <br/>end of period&nbsp;  <br/><br/>Notes :<br/><br/>1.
