Financial results for the five months ended August 31, 1999<p>


*********************************************************<p>


<p>


<p>


     The Government announced today (Thursday) its financial results for the five 
months ended August 31, 1999.<p>


<p>


     Expenditure for the first five months of the current financial year amounted to 
$93,672.2 million and revenue to $57,643.3 million, resulting in a deficit of $36,028.9 
million.<p>


<p>


     The fiscal reserves stood at $398,273.5 million at August 31, a decrease of 
$36,028.9 million compared with the balance of $434,302.4 million at March 31, 1999, 
the end of the previous financial year.<p>


<p>


     A government spokesman said that the Government's accounts were prepared 
on a cash basis and reflected the incidence of receipts and payments during the 
period.<p>


<p>


     "Because the bulk of collections from Profits Tax and Salaries Tax are 
normally received in the latter part of the year (roughly 85% of Profits Tax in the last 
five months and 80% of Salaries Tax in the last three months), it is not unusual, even in 
good years, to see a substantial deficit in the early months of the financial year," he 
added.<p>


<p>


     More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<p>
