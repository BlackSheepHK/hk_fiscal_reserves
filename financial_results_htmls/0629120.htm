Financial results for the two months ended May 31, 2000<p>
*******************************************************<p>
<p>
<p>
	The Government announced today (June 30) its financial results for the two months ended May 31, 2000.<p>
<p>
	Expenditure for the period April to May 2000 amounted to $35.9 billion and revenue to $28.8 billion, resulting in a deficit of $7.1 billion.<p>
<p>
	A Government spokesman said that a deficit in the initial months of a financial year was not unusual as many major types of revenue including taxes were mostly received towards the end of a financial year.<p>
<p>
	The fiscal reserves stood at $437.2 billion at May 31, 2000.<p>
<p>
	More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<p>
