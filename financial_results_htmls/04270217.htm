Provisional financial results for year ended March<br> 31, 2005<p>

	  **************************************************<p>

<p>

<p>
	   &nbsp; &nbsp; The Government announced today (April 27) its provisional financial results for the year ended March 31, 2005.
<p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Expenditure for the year ended March 31, 2005 amounted to $242.2 billion and revenue to $263.6 billion, resulting in a surplus of $21.4 billion. The revenue for the year, and thus the surplus, have taken account of the $6 billion Toll Revenue Bond and $20 billion Government bonds and notes issued in May and July 2004 respectively.
<p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; The fiscal reserves stood at $296 billion at March 31, 2005, an increase of $20.7 billion compared with the balance of $275.3 billion at March 31, 2004. This increase comprised the surplus of $21.4 billion for the year ended March 31, 2005, offset partly by a provision of $0.7 billion for the fall in the market value of the fiscal reserves invested with the Exchange Fund during the period from January 1, 2005 to March 31, 2005.
<p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; A Government spokesman said that the provisional surplus of $21.4 billion represented an improvement of $9.4 billion over the revised surplus of $12 billion forecast in the 2005-06 Budget. Revenue was $1.9 billion better than expected, largely as a result of additional receipts from salaries tax, stamp duties and land premium, and expenditure was $7.5 billion lower than forecast.
<p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; The spokesman added that all figures were provisional pending the final closing of the annual accounts but that experience showed that any changes to the provisional figures were unlikely to be significant.
<p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.
