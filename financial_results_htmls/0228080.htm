<p>

     The Government announced today (February 28) its financial results for the ten months ended January 31, 2004.<p>

<p>

     Expenditure for the period April 2003 to January 2004 amounted to $202.9 billion and revenue to $157.7 billion, resulting in a deficit of $45.2 billion.  There was a surplus of $25.8 billion in January.<p>

<p>

     A Government spokesman said that the surplus of $25.8 billion for the month of January 2004 reflected the salaries tax and profits tax collections in that month.  He added that an up-to-date assessment of the likely deficit for the current financial year will be provided by the Financial Secretary in his Budget Speech on March 10, 2004.<p>

<p>

     The fiscal reserves stood at $270.3 billion at January 31, 2004.<p>
