Financial results for the ten months ended January<br> 31, 2005<p>

	  **************************************************<p>

<p>

<p>
	   &nbsp; &nbsp; The Government announced today (February 28) its financial results for the ten months ended January 31, 2005. 
<p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; There was a surplus of $25.2 billion in January, thereby bringing a net surplus of $22.4 billion up to end of January. &nbsp;Expenditure for the period April 2004 to January 2005 amounted to $200.2 billion and revenue to $222.6 billion. &nbsp;The revenue for the period, and thus the surplus, have taken account of the $6 billion Toll Revenue Bond and $20 billion Government bonds and notes issued in May and July 2004 respectively.
<p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; A Government spokesman said that the surplus of $25.2 billion for the month of January, 2005, reflected the Salaries Tax and Profits Tax receipts. &nbsp;He added that an assessment of the likely result for the current financial year would be provided by the Financial Secretary in his Budget Speech on March 16, 2005.
<p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; The fiscal reserves stood at $297.8 billion at January 31, 2005.
<p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.
