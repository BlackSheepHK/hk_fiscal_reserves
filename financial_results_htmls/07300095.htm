Financial results for the three months ended June <br>30, 2005<p>

	  **************************************************<p>

<p>

<p>
	   &nbsp; &nbsp; The Government announced today (July 30) its financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2005.
<p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; Expenditure for the period April to June, 2005, amounted to $56.4 billion and revenue to $39.7 billion, resulting in a deficit of $16.7 billion. 
<p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; A government spokesman said that a deficit in the initial months of a financial year was not unusual as many types of revenue including taxes were mostly received towards the end of the year.
<p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; The fiscal reserves stood at $279.3 billion at June 30, 2005.
<p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.
