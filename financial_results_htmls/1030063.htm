Financial results for the six months ended September 30, 2004
	  <p> *********************************************
	  <p>

<p>

<p>

     The Government announced today (October 30) its financial results for the six months ended September 30, 2004.<p>

<p>

     Expenditure for the period April to September 2004 amounted to $118.2 billion and revenue to $95.5 billion, resulting in a deficit of $22.7 billion. The revenue for the period, and thus the deficit, have taken account of the $6 billion Toll Revenue Bond and $20 billion Government bonds and notes issued in May and July 2004 respectively.<p>

<p>

     A government spokesman explained that some major revenue items including salaries and profits taxes were mostly received towards the end of a financial year. It was too early at this stage to draw any conclusion on the deficit outturn for the full year.<p>

<p>

     The fiscal reserves stood at $252.6 billion at September 30, 2004.<p>

<p>

     More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<p>
