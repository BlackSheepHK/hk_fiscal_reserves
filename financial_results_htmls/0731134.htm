Financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2000<p>



*********************************************************<p>

<p>



     The Government announced today (July 31) the financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2000.<p>



<p>



     Expenditure for the period April to June 2000 amounted to $52.6 billion and revenue to $37 billion, resulting in a deficit of $15.6 billion.<p>



<p>



     A Government spokesman said that a deficit in the initial months of a financial year was not unusual as many major types of revenue including taxes were mostly received towards the end of a financial year.<p>



<p>



     The fiscal reserves stood at $428.7 billion at June 30, 2000.<p>



<p>



     More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<p>
