Financial results for the four months ended July 31, 2000<p>



*********************************************************<p>



<p>



<p>



    The Government announced today (August 31) its financial results for the four months ended July 31, 2000.<p>



<p>



     Expenditure for the period April to July 2000 amounted to $70.5 billion and revenue to $48.9 billion, resulting in a deficit of $21.6 billion.<p>



<p>



     A Government spokesman said that a deficit in the initial months of a financial year was not unusual as many major types of revenue including taxes were mostly received towards the end of a financial year.<p>



<p>



     The fiscal reserves stood at $422.7 billion at July 31, 2000.<p>



<p>



     More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<p>
