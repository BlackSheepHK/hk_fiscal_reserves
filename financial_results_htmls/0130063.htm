Financial results for nine months ended December 31
<P>**************************************************
<P>
<P>
<P>     The government announced today (Saturday) the financial results for the nine months ended December 31, 1998.
<P>
<P>     Expenditure for the current fiscal year to date amounts to $165,548.7 million and revenue to $127,494.4 million, resulting in a deficit for the nine months to December of $38,054.3 million.  This is  $2,491.8 million higher than that for the period to November.
<P>
<P>     As a result, the fiscal reserves stood at $427,793.8 million at December 31, a decrease of $29,749.2 million compared with the level at March 31, 1998, that is the end of the previous financial year.
<P>
<P>     A government spokesman said that revenue would pick up significantly in the final quarter of the year as over  80 per cent of Salaries Tax was collected in the three months from January to March.  An up to date assessment of the likely deficit for the current fiscal year will be provided by the Financial Secretary in his Budget Speech on March 3, 1999.
<P>
<P>     More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.
