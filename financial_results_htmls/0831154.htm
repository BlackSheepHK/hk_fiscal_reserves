Financial results for the four months ended July 31, 1999<p>
*********************************************************<p>
<p>
<p>
     The Government announced today (Tuesday) its financial results for the four months ended July 31, 1999.<p>
<p>
     Expenditure for the first four months of the current financial year amounted to $76,983.3 million and revenue to $47,295 million, resulting in a deficit of $29,688.3 million.<p>
<p>
     The fiscal reserves stood at $404,614.1 million at July 31, a decrease of $29,688.3 million compared with the balance of $434,302.4 million at March 31, 1999, the end of the previous financial year.<p>
<p>
     A government spokesman said that the Government's accounts were prepared on a cash basis and reflected the incidence of receipts and payments during the period.<p>
<p>
     "Because the bulk of collections from Profits Tax and Salaries Tax are normally received in the latter part of the year (roughly 85% of Profits Tax in last five months and 80% of Salaries Tax in the last three months) it is not unusual, even in good years, to see a substantial deficit in the early months of the financial year." he added.<p>
<p>
     More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<p>
