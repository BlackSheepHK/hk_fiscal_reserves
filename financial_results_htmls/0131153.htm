Financial results for nine months ended 31.12.00<p>
*************************************************<p>
<p>
<p>
     The Government announced today (January 31) its financial results for the nine months ended December 31, 2000.<p>
<p>
     Expenditure for the period April to December 2000 amounted to $162.7 billion and revenue to $132.5 billion, resulting in a deficit of $30.2 billion.<p>
<p>
     A Government spokesman said that revenue would pick up in the final quarter of the year as roughly 80% of Salaries Tax was collected in the three months from January to March.  An up-to-date assessment of the likely deficit for the current financial year will be provided by the Financial Secretary in his Budget Speech on March 7, 2001.<p>
<p>
     The fiscal reserves stood at $414.1 billion at December 31, 2000.<p>
