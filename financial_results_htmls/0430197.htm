Provisional financial results for year ended March 31, 2003<p>

***********************************************************<p>

<p>

<p>

     The Government announced today (April 30) its provisional financial results for the year ended March 31, 2003.<p>

<p>

     According to the provisional results, expenditure for the year ended March 31, 2003 amounts to $239.2 billion and revenue to $177.5 billion, resulting in a deficit of $61.7 billion.<p>

<p>

     The provisional deficit of $61.7 billion is $8.3 billion lower than the revised estimate of $70 billion announced in the 2003-04 Budget Speech.  This is because while on the one hand, total expenditure is $4.2 billion lower than the revised estimate, revenue is $4.1 billion better than the revised estimate, largely as a result of additional revenue from profits and salaries taxes, income from investments with the Exchange Fund and higher-than-expected loan repayments. <p>

<p>

     The balance of fiscal reserves is $311.4 billion at March 31, 2003 and is $8.4 billion more than the revised estimate of $303.0 billion, mainly because of the less than expected outturn deficit mentioned above.  <p>

<p>

     A Government spokesman added that all figures were provisional pending the final closing of the annual accounts but that experience showed that any changes to the provisional figures were unlikely to be significant.<p>

<p>

     More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<p>
