Financial results for 9 months ended 31.12.99<p>

     The Government announced today (Monday) its financial results for the nine months ended December 31, 1999.<p>



<p>



     Expenditure for the period April to December 1999 amounted to $163,468.6 million and revenue to $118,763.1 million, resulting in a deficit of $44,705.5 million.<p>



<p>



     The fiscal reserves stood at $389,596.9 million at December 31, a decrease of $44,705.5 million compared with the balance of $434,302.4 million at March 31, 1999, the end of the previous financial year.<p>



<p>



     A Government spokesman said that revenue would pick up significantly in the final quarter of the year as over  80% of Salaries Tax was collected in the three months from January to March.  An up to date assessment of the likely deficit for the current fiscal year will be provided by the Financial Secretary in his Budget Speech on March 8, 2000.<p>
