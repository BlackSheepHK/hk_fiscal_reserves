<p>

     The Government announced today (November 29) its financial results for the seven months ended October 31, 2003.<p>

<p>

     Expenditure for the period April to October 2003 amounted to $141.6 billion and revenue to $60.5 billion, resulting in a deficit of $81.1 billion.<p>

<p>

     A Government spokesman explained that some major revenue items including salaries and profits taxes were mostly received towards the end of a financial year.  It was too early at this stage to draw any conclusion on the deficit outturn for the full year.<p>

<p>

     The fiscal reserves stood at $234.4 billion at October 31, 2003.<p>

<p>

     More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<p>
