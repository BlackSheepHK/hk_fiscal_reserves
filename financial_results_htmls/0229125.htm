Financial results for ten months ended January 31, 2000<p>
*******************************************************<p>
<p>
<p>
     The Government announced today (Tuesday) its financial results for the ten months ended January 31, 2000.<p>
<p>
     Expenditure for the period April 1999 to January 2000 amounted to $183,272.4 million and revenue to $161,553.3 million, resulting in a deficit of $21,719.1 million.<p>
<p>
     The fiscal reserves stood at $412,583.3 million at January 31, 2000, a decrease of $21,719.1 million compared with the balance of $434,302.4 million at March 31, 1999, the end of the previous financial year.<p>
<p>
     There was a surplus of $22,986.4 million in January.   A Government spokesman said that the improvement in the finances was mainly due to the normal high level of Salaries Tax receipts during the month.  An up-to-date assessment of the likely deficit for the current fiscal year will be provided by the Financial Secretary in his Budget Speech on March 8, 2000.<p>

     More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<p>
