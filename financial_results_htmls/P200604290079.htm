	      Provisional financial results for the year ended March 31, 2006<br />

	    ***********************************************************<p>

	     &nbsp; &nbsp; The Government today (April 29) announced its provisional financial results for the year ended March 31, 2006.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Expenditure for the year ended March 31, 2006, amounted to $233.1 billion and revenue to $247.1 billion, resulting in a surplus of $14 billion.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A government spokesman said that the surplus of $14 billion represented an improvement of $9.9 billion over the $4.1 billion surplus forecast in the 2006-07 Budget. He said the improved financial position was mainly due to higher collections in stamp duties, salaries tax, profits tax and land premium towards the end of the financial year. These increases in revenue totalled $5.4 billion. &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the other hand, expenditure was $4.5 billion lower than forecast as a result of the strenuous efforts of departments to rein in expenditure and spend only where necessary. &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The spokesman noted that the variance in expenditure between the revised estimate and the provisional results this year was actually smaller than those in the previous two years, i.e. $4.5 billion in 2005-06 compared with $7.5 billion in 2004-05 and $5.4 billion in 2003-04. This reflects continuous efforts of various bureaux and departments to improve their financial management.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Furthermore, of the $4.5 billion variance in expenditure in 2005-06, only $2.2 billion was due to underspending in operating expenditure, which was just about one percent of the total operating expenditure for the year. &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fiscal reserves stood at $310.7 billion at March 31, 2006, an increase of $14.7 billion compared with the balance of $296.0 billion at March 31, 2005. This increase comprised the surplus of $14.0 billion for the year ended March 31, 2006 and $0.7 billion for write-back of provision for loss in investments with the Exchange Fund made in 2004-05.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The spokesman added that all figures were provisional pending the final closing of the annual accounts but experience showed that any changes to the provisional figures were unlikely to be significant.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<br /><br />TABLE 1. &nbsp;CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNT (PROVISIONAL)<br /><br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Month ended &nbsp; &nbsp; Year ended <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; March 31, 2006 &nbsp;March 31, 2006<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-------------- &nbsp; --------------<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; HK$ million &nbsp; &nbsp;HK$ million<br /><br />Revenue &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 24,854.7 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;247,027.1<br />Expenditure &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(22,928.4) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(233,069.9)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ------------ &nbsp; &nbsp;------------<br />Surplus &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1,926.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 13,957.2<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ------------ &nbsp; &nbsp;------------<br /><br />Financing<br />&nbsp; Domestic<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Banking Sector(Note 1) (2,072.5) &nbsp; &nbsp; (15,490.2)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Non-Banking Sector &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;146.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1,533.0<br />&nbsp; External &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;---------- &nbsp; ------------<br />Total &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(1,926.3) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(13,957.2)<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;---------- &nbsp; ------------<br /><br /><br />Government Debts as at March 31, 2006 (Note 2)<br />&nbsp; HK$24,589.9 million<br /><br />Debts Guaranteed by Government as at March 31, 2006 (Note 3) <br />&nbsp; HK$5,320.4 million<br /><br /><br />Notes:<br /><br />1. &nbsp;Includes transactions with the Exchange Fund and resident banks.<br /><br />2. &nbsp;The total government debts of $24,589.9 million as at March 31, 2006 comprise :<br /><br />(i) &nbsp;Toll Revenue Bond of $4,639.9 million to be repaid to Hong Kong Link 2004 Limited by the net toll revenue receivable of government tolled tunnels and bridges.
