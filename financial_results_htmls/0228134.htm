***************************************************<p>
<p>
<p>
     The Government announced today (February 28) its financial results for the ten months ended January 31, 2001.<p>
<p>
     Expenditure for the period April 2000 to January 2001 amounted to $182.5 billion and revenue to $180.3 billion, resulting in a deficit of $2.2 billion.<p>
<p>
     There was a surplus of $28 billion in January.  A Government spokesman said that the improvement was mainly due to the Salaries Tax and Profits Tax receipts during the month.  An up-to-date assessment of the likely deficit for the current financial year will be provided by the Financial Secretary in his Budget Speech on March 7, 2001.<p>
<p>
     The fiscal reserves stood at $442.1 billion at January 31, 2001.<p>
