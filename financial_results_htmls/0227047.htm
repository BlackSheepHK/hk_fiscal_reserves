Financial results for 10 months ended 31.1.99<p>
*********************************************<p>
<p>
<p>
     The Government announced today (Saturday) its financial results for the ten months ended January 31, 1999.<p>
<p>
     Expenditure for the current fiscal year to date amounts to $193,200.7 million and revenue to $165,720.1 million, resulting in a deficit for the ten months to January of $27,480.6 million.  This is $10,573.7 million lower than that for the period to December.<p>
<p>
     After taking account of the increase in the net worth of the Land Fund, the fiscal reserves stood at $438,367.5 million at January 31, 1999, a decrease of $19,175.5 million compared with the level at March 31, 1998, the end of the previous financial year.<p>
<p>
     A Government spokesman said that the improvement in the finances in January was mainly due to the normal high level of Salaries Tax receipts during the month.  An up to date assessment of the likely deficit for the current fiscal year will be provided by the Financial Secretary in his Budget Speech on March 3, 1999.<p>
<p>
     More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<p>
