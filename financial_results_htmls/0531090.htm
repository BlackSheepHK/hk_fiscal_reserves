Financial results for the month ended April 30, 2003<p>

****************************************************<p>

<p>

<p>

     The Government announced today (May 31) its financial results for the first month ended April 30, 2003.<p>

<p>

     Expenditure for the first month of the current financial year (2003/04) amounted to $19.3 billion and revenue to $12.8 billion, resulting in a deficit of $6.5 billion.<p>

<p>

     The fiscal reserves stood at $309 billion as at April 30, 2003.  This includes the balance of $4 billion in the Lotteries Fund, which has been consolidated into the Government's accounts with effect from the current financial year.<p>

<p>

     A Government spokesman said that a deficit in the initial months of a financial year was not unusual as many major types of revenue including taxes were mostly received towards the end of a financial year.<p>

<p>

     More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<p>
