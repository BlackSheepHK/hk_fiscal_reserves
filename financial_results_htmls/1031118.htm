Financial results for April to September 2000<p>



*********************************************<p>



<p>



<p>



     The Government announced today (October 31) its financial results for the six months ended September 30, 2000.<p>



<p>



     Expenditure for the period April to September 2000 amounted to $107.3 billion and revenue to $66.7 billion, resulting in a deficit of $40.6 billion.<p>



<p>



     A Government spokesman said that a deficit in the first half of a financial year was not unusual as many major types of revenue including taxes were mostly received towards the end of a financial year.<p>



<p>



     The fiscal reserves stood at $403.6 billion at September 30, 2000.<p>



<p>



     More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<p>
