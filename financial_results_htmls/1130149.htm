Financial results for seven months ended October 31, 2004<p> *********************************************************<p> <p> <p>      The Government announced today (November 30) its financial results for the seven months ended October 31, 2004.<p> <p>      Expenditure for the period April to October 2004 amounted to $139.2 billion and revenue to $113.9 billion, resulting in a deficit of $25.3 billion. The revenue for the period, and thus the deficit, have taken account of the $6 billion Toll Revenue Bond and $20 billion Government bonds and notes issued in May and July 2004 respectively.<p> <p>      A Government spokesman explained that given the performance to date, the outturn deficit was likely to be less than the original forecast deficit of $42.6 billion. However, it was too early at this stage to draw any conclusion on the deficit outturn for the full year, as some major revenue items including salaries and profits taxes were mostly received towards the end of a financial year.<p> <p>      The fiscal reserves stood at $250.1 billion at October 31, 2004.<p> <p>      More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<p> <p> <pre>TABLE 1.
