Financial results for eleven months ended February 28, 2002<p> *********************************************************<p> <p> <p>      The Government announced today (March 28) its financial results for the eleven months ended February 28, 2002.<p> <p>      Expenditure for the period April 2001 to February 2002 amounted to $214 billion and revenue to $164.3 billion, resulting in a deficit of $49.7 billion.<p> <p>      A Government spokesman said that the deficit for the year ending March 31, 2002 would likely be larger than the deficit at the end of February 2002.  This was because the Government expected, during March 2002, expenditure to be incurred to greatly exceed revenue to be collected.  The main reason for this is that minimal revenue is anticipated from investment income of fiscal reserves for the year of 2001 which will be credited into the Government accounts in the month of March 2002.  In the past, revenue from this source helped to reduce deficit, if any, for that financial year.<p> <p>      The fiscal reserves stood at $380.6 billion at February 28, 2002.<p> <p>      More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<pre><p> <p> TABLE 1.
