	      Provisional financial results for the year ended March 31, 2007<br />

	    ***********************************************************<p>

	     &nbsp; &nbsp; The Government announced today (April 30) its provisional financial results for the year ended March 31, 2007.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Expenditure for the year ended March 31, 2007 was $229.4 billion and revenue $288 billion, resulting in a surplus of $58.6 billion.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A government spokesman said that the surplus of $58.6 billion represented an improvement of $3.5 billion over the $55.1 billion surplus forecast in the 2007-08 Budget. &nbsp;He said the improved financial position was mainly because the actual expenditure for the year was &nbsp;$3.6 billion lower than forecast as a result of the strenuous efforts of departments to rein in expenditure and spend only where necessary. &nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The spokesman noted that the variance between the revised estimate and the provisional results this year was the smallest over the past five years. &nbsp;This reflects continuous efforts of bureaux and departments to improve their financial management.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The fiscal reserves stood at $369.3 billion as at March 31, 2007, an increase of $58.6 billion compared with the balance of $310.7 billion as at March 31, 2006.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The spokesman added that all figures were provisional pending the final closing of the annual accounts but experience showed that any changes to the provisional figures were unlikely to be significant.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<br /><br /><br />TABLE 1. &nbsp;CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNT (PROVISIONAL)<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
