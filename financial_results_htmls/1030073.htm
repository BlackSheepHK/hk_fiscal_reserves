Financial results for the six months ended 30.9.1999<p>


****************************************************<p>


<p>


<p>


     The Government announced today (Saturday) its financial results for the six 
months ended September 30, 1999.<p>


<p>


     Expenditure for the period April to September 1999 amounted to $110,454.8 
million and revenue to $68,520.5 million, resulting in a deficit of $41,934.3 
million.<p>


<p>


     The fiscal reserves stood at $392,368.1 million at September 30, a decrease of 
$41,934.3 million compared with the balance of $434,302.4 million at March 31, 1999, 
the end of the previous financial year.<p>


<p>


     On the deficit, a Government spokesman explained that since the 
Government's accounts were prepared on a cash basis, they reflected the incidence of 
receipts and payments during the period.<p>


<p>


     "The bulk of collections from Profits Tax and Salaries Tax were normally 
received in the latter part of the year, with roughly 85% of Profits Tax in the last five 
months and 80% of Salaries Tax in the last three months," he said.<p>


<p>


     "Therefore, it was not unusual, even in good years, to see a substantial deficit 
in the first half of the financial year," he added.<p>


<p>


    More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<p>
