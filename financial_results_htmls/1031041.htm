Government announces financial results<p>
**************************************<p>
<p>
<p>
     As a further step towards meeting the International Monetary Fund's Special Data Dissemination Standard (IMF SDDS), the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, from now on, will release a monthly summary of its financial results.<p>
<p>
     Details in respect of the financial results for the six months ended September 30, 1998 is set out below:<p>
<p>
     Expenditure for the year to date amounts to $115,202 million and revenue to $72,601.3 million, resulting in a deficit for the first six months of the financial year of $42,600.7 million.  In addition, the net worth of the Land Fund has increased by $2,973.4 million since April 1, 1998.<p>
<p>
     As a result, the fiscal reserves stood at $417,915.7 million at September 30, 1998, a decrease of $39,627.3 million compared with the level at March 31, 1998, the end of the previous financial year.<p>
<p>
	Because the government's accounts are prepared on a cash basis and since the bulk of the collections from Profits Tax and Salaries Tax are normally received in the second half of the financial year (roughly 90% of Profits Tax and 80% of Salaries Tax), it is not unusual, even in good years, to see a substantial deficit in the first half of the financial year.<p>

     More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2 -<p>
