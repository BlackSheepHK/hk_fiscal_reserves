Financial results for the eight months ended November 30, 2000<p>
*********************************************************<p>
<p>
<p>
     The Government announced today (December 30) its financial results for the eight months ended November 30, 2000.<p>
<p>
     Expenditure for the period April to November 2000 amounted to $143.9 billion and revenue to $115.2 billion, resulting in a deficit of $28.7 billion.<p>
<p>
     There was a surplus of $9.7 billion in November.  A Government spokesman said the improvement was mainly due to Profits Tax receipts during the month.  The position should further improve with the bulk of the revenue from Profits Tax and Salaries Tax to be collected in the remaining months of the financial year.<p>
<p>
     The fiscal reserves stood at $415.5 billion at November 30, 2000.<p>
<p>
     More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<p>
