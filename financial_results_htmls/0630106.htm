***************************************************<p>

<p>
     The government announced today (Wednesday) its financial results for the two months ended May 31, 1999.<p>
<p>
     Expenditure for the first two months of the current financial year amounted to $42,113.7 million and revenue to $24,186 million, resulting in a deficit of $17,927.7 million for the two months to May 31, 1999.<p>
<p>
     The fiscal reserves stood at $416,374.7 million at May 31, 1999, a decrease of $17,927.7 million compared with the balance of $434,302.4 million at March 31, 1999, the end of the previous financial year.<p>

     A government spokesman said that the Government's accounts were prepared on a cash basis and reflected the incidence of receipts and payments during the period.<p>
<p>
     "The results are in line with our expectations, based on the budgeted deficit for the year of $36.5 billion as announced by the Financial Secretary in his Budget Speech on March 3, 1999," he added.<p>
