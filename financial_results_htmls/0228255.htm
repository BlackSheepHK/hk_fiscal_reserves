Financial results for the ten months ended January 31, 2002
      <p> ***************************************************
      <p>

<p>

<p>

	The Government announced today (February 28) its financial results for the ten months ended January 31, 2002.<p>

<p>

	Expenditure for the period April 2001 to January 2002 amounted to $195.2 billion and revenue to $154.7 billion, resulting in a deficit of $40.5 billion.  There was a surplus of $20.2 billion in January.<p>

<p>

	A government spokesman said the surplus of $20.2 billion for the month of January 2002 reflected the salary tax and profits tax collections in that month.<p>

<p>

	He also explained that the deficit for the year ending March 31, 2002 would likely be substantially larger than the deficit at the end of January 2002.  This was because the Government expected expenditure to be incurred during the two months of February and March 2002 to greatly exceed revenue to be collected during these two months.  The main reason for this is that minimal revenue is anticipated from investment income of fiscal reserves for the year of 2001 which will be credited into the Government accounts in the month of March 2002.  In the past, revenue from this source helped to reduce deficit, if any, for that financial year.<p>

<p>

	He added that an up-to-date assessment of the likely deficit for the current financial year will be announced by the Financial Secretary when he delivers the 2002-03 Budget Speech to the Legislative Council on March 6, 2002.<p>

<p>

     The fiscal reserves stood at $389.7 billion at January 31, 2002.<p>
