<p>

<p>
	   &nbsp; &nbsp; The Government announced today (June 30) its financial results for the two months ended May 31, 2005.
<br />
<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; Expenditure for the period April to May 2005 amounted to $38.4 billion and revenue to $30 billion, resulting in a deficit of $8.4 billion. 
<br />
<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; A Government spokesman said that a deficit in the initial months of a financial year was not unusual as many types of revenue including taxes were mostly received towards the end of the year.
<br />
<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; The fiscal reserves stood at $287.6 billion at May 31, 2005.
<br />
<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp; More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.
