Financial results for the four months ended July 31, 2002<p>

**********************************************<p>

<p>

<p>

     The Government announced today (August 31) its financial results for the four months ended July 31, 2002.<p>

<p>

     Expenditure for the period April to July 2002 amounted to $78.7 billion and revenue to $38.6 billion, resulting in a deficit of $40.1 billion.<p>

<p>

     A Government spokesman said that a deficit in the initial months of a financial year was not unusual as many major types of revenue including taxes were mostly received towards the end of a financial year.<p>

<p>

     The fiscal reserves stood at $332.4 billion at July 31, 2002.<p>

<p>

     More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<p>
