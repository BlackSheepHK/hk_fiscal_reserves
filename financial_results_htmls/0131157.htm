Financial results for the nine months ended December 31, 2004<p>
*********************************************************<p>
<p>
<p>
     The Government announced today (January 31) its financial results for the nine months ended December 31, 2004. <p>
<p>
     There was a surplus of $0.2 billion in December, thereby reducing the year-to-date deficit to $2.8 billion for the period April to December 2004. Expenditure for the period April to December 2004 amounted to $179 billion and revenue to $176.2 billion. The revenue for the period, and thus the deficit, have taken account of the $6 billion Toll Revenue Bond and $20 billion Government bonds and notes issued in May and July 2004 respectively.<p>
<p>
     A Government spokesman said that the surplus in December was mainly due to Profits Tax and Salaries Tax receipts. He added that an assessment of the likely result for the current financial year would be provided by the Financial Secretary in his Budget Speech on March 16, 2005.<p>
<p>
     The fiscal reserves stood at $272.6 billion at December 31, 2004.<p>
<p>
     More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<p>
