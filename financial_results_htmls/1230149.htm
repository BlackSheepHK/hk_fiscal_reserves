Financial results for the eight months ended November 30, 1999<p>
**************************************************************<p>
<p>
<p>
      The Government announced today (Thursday) its financial results for the eight months ended November 30, 1999.<p>
<p>
      Expenditure for the period April to November 1999 amounted to $144,988.1 million and revenue to $106,134.1 million, resulting in a deficit of $38,854 million.<p>
<p>
      The fiscal reserves stood at $395,448.4 million at November 30, a decrease of $38,854 million compared with the balance of $434,302.4 million at March 31, 1999, the end of the previous financial year.<p>
<p>
      There was a surplus of $11,201 million in November.  A government spokesman said the improvement was due to Profits Tax receipts during the month.  The position should further improve with the bulk of the revenue from Profits Tax and Salaries Tax to be collected in the remaining months of the financial year.<p>
<p>
      More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<p>
