Financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2003<p>

*********************************************************<p>

<p>

<p>

     The Government announced today (July 31) its financial results for the three months ended June 30, 2003.<p>

<p>

     Expenditure for the period April to June 2003 amounted to $59 billion and revenue to $30.1 billion, resulting in a deficit of $28.9 billion.<p>

<p>

     A Government spokesman said that a deficit in the initial months of a financial year was not unusual as many major types of revenue including taxes were mostly received towards the end of a financial year.<p>

<p>

     The fiscal reserves stood at $286.6 billion at June 30, 2003.<p>

<p>

     More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<p>
