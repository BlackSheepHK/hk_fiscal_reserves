Financial results for the five months ended August 31, 2004<p>

*********************************************************<p>

<p>

<p>

     The Government announced today (September 30) its financial results for the five months ended August 31, 2004.<p>

<p>

     Expenditure for the period April to August 2004 amounted to $99.2 billion and revenue to $83.3 billion, resulting in a deficit of $15.9 billion.  The revenue for the period, and thus the deficit, have taken account of the $6 billion Toll Revenue Bond and $20 billion Government bonds and notes issued in May and July 2004 respectively.<p>

<p>

     A government spokesman said that a deficit in the initial months of a financial year was not unusual as many types of revenue including taxes were mostly received towards the end of the year.<p>

<p>

     The fiscal reserves stood at $259.4 billion at August 31, 2004.<p>

<p>

     More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<p>
