Financial results for the eleven months ended Feb 1999<p>
**************************************************<p>
<p>
<p>
     The government announced today (Wednesday), its results for the eleven months ended February 28, 1999.<p>
<p>
     Expenditure for the current fiscal year to date amounts to $210,392.1 million and revenue to $178,407.1 million, resulting in a deficit for the eleven months to February of $31,985 million.  This is  $4,504.4 million higher than that for the period to January.  After taking account of the increase in the net worth of the Land Fund, the deficit for the year 1998-99 to end February 1999 was $23,679.9 million.  The Financial Secretary announced in his Budget Speech on March 3, 1999 that he expected the deficit for 1998-99 to amount to $32.3 billion.<p>
<p>
     The fiscal reserves stood at $433,863.1 million as at February 28, 1999, a decrease of $23,679.9 million compared with the level as at March 31, 1998, the end of the previous financial year.<p>
<p>
     A government spokesman said that the results for the first eleven months reflect the effect of the package of special relief measures announced on 22 June 1998 as well as a general slow-down in revenue collections as a result of the economic downturn.<p>
<p>
     More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<p>
