Financial results for the month ended April 30, 2000<p>
****************************************************<p>
<p>
<p>
     The Government announced today (May 31) its financial results for the first month ended April 30, 2000.<p>
<p>
     Expenditure for the first month of the current financial year amounted to $17.5 billion and revenue to $15.4 billion, resulting in a deficit of $2.1 billion.  <p>
<p>
     A Government spokesman said that a deficit in the initial months of a financial year was not unusual as many major types of revenue including taxes were mostly received towards the end of a financial year.<p>
<p>
     The fiscal reserves stood at $442.2 billion at April 30, 2000.<p>
<p>
     More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<p>
