Financial results for the eight months ended November 30, 98<p>

**********************************************************<p>

<p>

<p>

     The Government announced today (Thursday) the financial results for the eight months ended November 30, 1998.<p>

<p>

     Expenditure for the year to date amounts to $148,068.5 million and revenue to $112,506 million, resulting in a deficit for the eight months to November of $35,562.5 million.  This is  $14,601.4 million lower than that for the period to October.<p>

<p>

     A Government spokesman said the improvement was due to Profits Tax receipts during the month.  The position should further improve with the bulk of the revenue from Profits Tax and Salaries Tax to be collected in the remaining months of the financial year.<p>

<p>

     As a result, the fiscal reserves stood at $430,285.6 million at November 30, 1998, a decrease of $27,257.4 million compared with the level at March 31, 1998, the end of the previous financial year.<p>
