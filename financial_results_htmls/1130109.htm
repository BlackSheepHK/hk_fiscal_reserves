Financial results for period April to October 1998
<P>**************************************************
<P>
<P>
<P>     The government announced today (Monday) its financial results for the seven months ended October 31, 1998.
<P>
<P>     Expenditure for the year to date amounts to $131,850.8 million and revenue to $81,686.9 million, resulting in a deficit for the seven months of the financial year of $50,163.9 million.  In addition, the net worth of the Land Fund has increased by $8,305.1 million since April 1, 1998.
<P>
<P>     As a result, the fiscal reserves stood at $415,684.2 million at October 31, 1998, a decrease of $41,858.8 million compared with the level at March 31, 1998, the end of the previous financial year.
<P>
<P>     A Government spokesman said: "Because the Government's accounts are prepared on a cash basis, and since the bulk of collections from Profits Tax and Salaries Tax are normally received in the latter part of the financial year (roughly 90% of Profit Tax in the last five months and 80% of Salaries Tax in the last three months), it is not unusual, even in good years, to see a substantial deficit in the first seven months of the financial year."
