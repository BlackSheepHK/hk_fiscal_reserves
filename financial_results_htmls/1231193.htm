Financial results for the eight months ended November 30, 2004<p>
*********************************************************<p>
<p>
<p>
     The Government announced today (December 31) its financial results for the eight months ended November 30, 2004.<p>
<p>
     There was a surplus of $22.3 billion in November, thereby reducing the year-to-date deficit to $3 billion for the period April to November 2004.  Expenditure for the period April to November 2004 amounted to $158.6 billion and revenue to $155.6 billion.  The revenue for the period, and thus the deficit, have taken account of the $6 billion Toll Revenue Bond and $20 billion Government bonds and notes issued in May and July 2004 respectively.<p>
<p>
     A Government spokesman said that the improvement recorded in November was mainly due to proceeds from sale of land and Profits Tax receipts.  He added that it was too early at this stage to draw any conclusion on the deficit outturn for the full year.<p>
<p>
     The fiscal reserves stood at $272.3 billion at November 30, 2004.<p>
<p>
     More detailed figures are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<p>
